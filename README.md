# prep
Local reimplementation of project hacker-tracker in Shoes

## Current capabilities

- Stores names and GitHub/Twitter handles of as many users as you like (leave blank to exit loop)
- Retrieves and parses event history from a repository

## Future capabilities

- GUI
- Allow the user to enter a timespan (owing to Prep's original purpose as a hackathon tracker)
- Get listed users' tweets during said time
- Output cleanly in a file
